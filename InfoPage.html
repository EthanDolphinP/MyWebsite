    <h2>Favourite Animal!</h2>
    <p>My current favourite animal is the Giant Ore Fish. <br>
        The Giant Ore Fish is a deep sea fish found in Asian waters. <br>
        They are rarely spotted as they only come near the surface <br>
        prior to or following large storms.</p>

    <h2>Favourite Coding Language!</h2>
    <p>My current favourite coding language is Python. <br>
        This is my favorite as I am currently learning it at college, <br>
        as well as the reduced syntax rules. For example I enjoy not having to use {} or ";"</p>
